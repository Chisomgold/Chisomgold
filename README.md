- 👋 Hi, I’m Halimat Chisom (Dexter)
- 👀 I’m a PhD student spending more than half of my time analysing biomedical and genomics data. My focus at the moment is cancer genome and epigenome, but I'm also interested in gastrointestinal disorders.
- 🌱 I have a working knowledge of molecular docking, computational drug design, and data analytics using differennt softwares and webservers. I'm also skilled at Python, R, MySQL, and Bash scripting.
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on any project related to biological data analysis and biomedical/genomics education/communication.
