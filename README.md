- 👋 Hi, I’m Halimat Chisom (Dexter)
- 👀 I’m interested in drug design and discovery and biomedical data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning molecular docking using differennt softwares and webservers. I'm also participating a bioinformatic hackathon that is set to last till the end of December, 2021.
If I do a good job - and I'm positive that I will - I'll have 2 publication- worthy research works by the end of the year. Fingers crossed.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to biological data analysis or drug design. I have basic knowledge of Python, R, MySQL, and Bash scripting.
